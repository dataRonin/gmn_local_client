    <abstract>
      <para>This data package consists of the long term study of Spartina alterniflora in salt marsh ecosystems.
        Specifically, the measurement of biomass, production, and stem density in various marsh
        sites to understand long-term patterns of Spartina growth and to relate these patterns to
        other factors in the LTER study.</para>

        <title>LTER Network Data Access Requirements</title>
        <para> The access to all LTER data is subject to requirements set forth by this
          policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in
          the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use.
          These requirements are standardized across the LTER Network to provide
          contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data
          Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged
          between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal
          once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be
          required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: <itemizedlist>

      <geographicCoverage>
        <geographicDescription>North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes and
          wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high
          quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the
          brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine
          discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial
          development. Former rice fields and canals provide another system for study within the
          Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek.
          The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to
          the mouth of Clambank Creek. GI is in the marsh east of Goat Island. It is accessible from
          Clambank Rd. about 1/4 mile from the firetower. A board walk connects the high marsh site
          and the low marsh site. OL is in the Oyster Landing basin. The high marsh site is located
          on the north side of the road which leads to the landing. The low marsh site lies between
          the boardwalk to the MET station and the small channel to the boat landing. GI is the
          older marsh site: the marsh sediments are about 50 cm deep, Organic content is somewhat
          higher, and it is closer to the ocean than OL. OL is a young marsh near the forest and
          close to a stream which drains a small forested watershed after big rainfalls. Salinities
          are often, but not always lower at OL. Spartina stem densities are lower at OL than at GI
          but annual production at the two sites is similar.

          <para> Multiple levels of entry verification were performed. Data were 
            initially checked for entry errors by Beth Thomas and Jan Blakely, 
            who originally entered the data on the full-screen management entry
            programs.  Once all data entry errors were corrected, hard copies of
            the data on the system were sent to Lynn Barker (the Research Specialist
            who counted the samples) to proof against the original raw data sheets.
            All data on the system from samples 1-275 (through December 1992) have 
            been certified error-free by Lynn Barker.

          <attributeDefinition> Indentifier for the plant: is 12 digit with a decimal between the
            first 6 and the second six. The first 6 digits specify the parent of a stem if it is
            known. The second 6 digits specify the stem. </attributeDefinition>

                    large enough to hold a band are tagged. Band color is indicated by the first
                    digit: 1=red,2=blue,3=yellow,4=white,5=pink. Digits 2,3,4 are the band number
                    (1-200). Digits 5 and 6 are the number of times the particular tag has been
                    used. A sprout that is too small for a tag is identified (as in above example)
                    by its parent and then is numbered 1,2,3 etc. for as many small sprouts as the
                    parent has. </definition>
